            <h1>Donate today, Help build a world with zero hunger</h1>
            <p>Today, 690 million people around the world will go to bed on an empty stomach. But your gift means that
                one less child will be at risk of starvation tonight.Whether you decide to make a one-off donation or
                set up a monthly gift, you can change a life forever today. Often, one meal at the right time will be
                enough to make a difference between life and death. </p>

            <h1>Donate Today</h1>
            <p>As soon as you complete your donation, your gift will start its journey. First your money will be turned
                into food, and then sent to one of the over 80 countries where people are most vulnerable. Every single
                day, WFP has 5,600 trucks, 30 ships and nearly 100 planes ready to deliver the food you send. Because
                you can't go there and hand out the food yourself, we do it for you.</p>

                Food, while not quite as critical as water, is also key to survival 2. People who have survived hunger
                strikes show that humans can live for some time without eating. However, without proper hydration, the
                body will only last between 40 and 70 days without food.</p>
